#Datacamp Learning Notes

A structured collection of notes, code snippets, and mini-projects from my DataCamp learning journey.  
Focused on Python, Machine Learning, and Analytics with applications in Reservoir Engineering and Energy systems.


ðŸ“š Purpose
This repository serves as:
- A personal reference for concepts learned
- A public portfolio to showcase practical applications
- A way to track my progress in data science and AI/ML skills

#ðŸ“Œ Note
Learning is a continuous journey â€” I will update this repository regularly as I complete more DataCamp courses and apply the skills to real-world datasets.
